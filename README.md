## üî≠ About
Welcome! This is unofficial documentation of the NIU Metis supercomputing systems by an undergraduate student at NIU.

My goal with this book is to eliminate the frustration of getting started on Metis, to allow fellow researchers to instead hit the ground running with their work.

You can find the link to the book in the top right of this page, or click [here](https://hiibolt.github.io/niu-metis-documentation/)!

To build this documentation:
```bash
$ mdbook build -d docs
```

## ‚ù§Ô∏è Acknowledgments
While my work was sponsored by the [NIU Student Engagement Fund](https://www.niu.edu/engaged-learning/funding/undergrad-research-funding.shtml) and [Illinois Innovation Network](https://iin.uillinois.edu/), it was a massive goal, and I wouldn't have been able to complete it without the help of the amazing members of the NIU iGait Research Team!

I would also like to thank the many NIU faculty and students who reached out to help mentor and train me, I will forever be appreciative of the support from NIU's academics.
