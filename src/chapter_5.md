# 5. Conclusion and Helpful Resources
This concludes my documentation for the NIU Metis supercomputing systems.

I genuinely hope this helps you achieve your goals on Metis, as using complex systems such as Metis is often daunting and time-consuming even for the most tenured of Linux users.

Despite being a Linux user, I am a strong believer in 'less time working on preparing to work'. This isn't to say I don't like planning - I use kanban boards for the most basic of tasks - but I do not enjoy spending time troubleshooting. While Linux is a large improvement over Windows for the purpose of development, things are not perfect, and much of a Linux user's time is spent working to get something fixed, rather than working on projects - the problem this guide aims to solve.

I hope this guide helped streamline your getting started on Metis. Below you can find additional resources to help your time on the Metis platform!

## Final Notes
I am an undergraduate student at NIU, and my GitHub is [@hiibolt](https://github.com/hiibolt). If you find errors or want additional clarification, feel free to open an issue on [this book's repository](https://github.com/hiibolt/niu-metis-documentation), or email me at `me@hiibolt.com`.

You can find more of my computation writing on my [blog](https://blog.hiibolt.com), on which I have an article about my time with the iGait development team, which I greatly enjoyed!

Thank you so much for taking time out of your day to read my work, and I wish you the best of luck in your academic endeavors.
