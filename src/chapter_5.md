# 5. Command Quick Reference

This chapter contains a quick reference to the most useful commands and their respective options for every example or topic mentioned thus far.

Each section also links the documentation, manual, or other source it summarizes. Even if an option or command isn't included, you can still find more information easily - and in one convenient location. 

For example, let's say you forgot which flag you need to name a container with Podman. You would otherwise have to flip through a chapter which uses it in practice or read the Podman documentation - both of which are time consuming.

Instead, you can simply find the most useful commands and options here!
