# 6. Conclusion and Helpful Resources
This concludes my documentation for the NIU Metis supercomputing systems.

I hope this helps you achieve your goals on Metis, and streamlined your getting started on Metis.

## Final Notes
I am an undergraduate student at NIU, and my GitHub is [@hiibolt](https://github.com/hiibolt). If you find errors or want additional clarification, feel free to open an issue on [this book's repository](https://github.com/hiibolt/niu-metis-documentation), or email me at `me@hiibolt.com`.

You can find more of my computation writing on my [blog](https://blog.hiibolt.com), on which I have an article about my time with the iGait development team, which I greatly enjoyed.

Thank you so much for reading my work, I wish you the best of luck in your academic endeavors.

*Stay cozy, this is @hiibolt, signing out :3*
