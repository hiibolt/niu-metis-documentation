# 2.1. C/C++ on Metis
## Chapter 2.1.1: Building a C++ Project from the Ground Up
* **Goals**: Familiarize with basic commands and job submission on Metis.
* **C++ Boilerplate**: Create and run a basic "Hello, World" C++ program with computational loops.
* **PBS Basics**: Write a PBS job script to run your C++ program on compute nodes.
* **Execution**: Compile and run the C++ program locally and via PBS.
* **Outcome**: You will be able to understand job submission, the PBS script structure, and basic module commands.
## Chapter 2.1.2: Building a CUDA Project from the Ground Up
* **Goals**: Learn to use CUDA for GPU programming on Metis.
* **CUDA Boilerplate**: Write a CUDA program to achieve the same task as in Chapter 1.1 but using GPU acceleration.
* **CUDA Modules**: Install and use the CUDA compiler (nvcc) with module commands.
* **Execution**: Compile and run your CUDA program, observing performance improvements.
* **PBS for CUDA**: Adapt the PBS script to load CUDA modules and compile with nvcc.
* **Outcome**: You will be able to leverage CUDA for faster computation and understand the structure of both CUDA programs and PBS scripts.
