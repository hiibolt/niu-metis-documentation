# 2. Basic Metis Usage
This first chapter will provide two into-the-fire projects that will teach you the core systems of Metis. This will be done through a simple C++ project, followed by an optimized version written with CUDA.

It's recommended to have a minimal knowledge of C++, CUDA, and Linux / Bash. If you haven't used any of these three before, or if it's been a while, linked below are some introductory resources:
* [Linux / Bash](https://ubuntu.com/tutorials/command-line-for-beginners#1-overview)
* [C++](https://www.w3schools.com/cpp/cpp_intro.asp)
* [CUDA](https://cuda-tutorial.readthedocs.io/en/latest/tutorials/tutorial01/)

These next two chapters lay the foundational skills needed to use the advanced techniques in the following chapters, and it is highly recommended that you read them before proceeding!

## Overview of the Chapters
### Chapter 2.1 - C/C++ on Metis
A general overview of how to get started with HPC distributed computing tactics on Metis in C++/C/CUDA.
### Chapter 2.2 - Rust on Metis
A advanced look at the various types of hardware acceleration available through the Rust Programming Language.
